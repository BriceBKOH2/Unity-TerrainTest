scripts files are in Assets\Asset Project\Scripts

TO DO LIST :
- All scripts are unlinked to all object and cant be relinked, apparently unity say the doesnt compile, but did previously and nothing seems wrong code wise, importing the project and updating it to current Unity version caused the problem (also reinstallied unity, maybe its an option problem)

-create .exe after reuploading to Unity (doesnt build after being uploaded and updated to current Unity version)
-from memory there should be a lava bug where the lava scrolling texture or script isnt working as intended after version changes (bug seems still present, cant confirm until being able to build and test it)

-make sure to test everything, especially underwater effects (also add death mechanic and/or respawn in spwan point option)
-more diverse terrain, fly option?
