scripts files are in Assets\Asset Project\Scripts

TO DO LIST :
-create .exe after reuploading to Unity
-from memory there should be a lava bug where the lava scrolling texture or script isnt working as intended after version changes

-make sure to test everything, especially underwater effects (also add death mechanic and/or respawn in spwan point option)
-more diverse terrain, fly option?
